Hey! I'm jokerlin. I am an AI engineer working at {ByteDance}.

I’m a builder at heart. I believe the world is made by those who ship, and I love the craft itself: thinking, prototyping, refining, and launching tools that help me and others work better and enjoy creating more. You can find my [full projects list here](/projects).

I write [blog posts](/posts) about AI, poker, coding, etc.

Outside of programming, I enjoy doing photography and traveling. I post [photos on this page](https://photos.jokerlin.us/). I also love anime, movies and dramas, I am trying to list my [library](/library). Also, in case you are interested, here are the [gear I use and setup](/setup).

I live in <ruby lang="ja">北京<rp>(</rp><rt>Beijing</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>, if you are around, please reach out and let's have some coffee or work together.
